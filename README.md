A simple scripting environment for .net standard applications.

> ** Work in Progress:** This project is currently a work in progress and is not ready to be consumed.

Chel is modelled after a command prompt, to provide a simple and intuative scripting environment.

Chel in a nutshell:

	# comment
	command
	command value
	command -parameter value
	command -flag
	command >> othercommand
	command << subcommand
