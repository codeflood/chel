# Modules #

Modules are a way of grouping commands and scripts together to avoid name collisions. The module name is separated from the command or script name by a colon (`:`).

    module:command
    module:script

## Help ##

Executing the `help` command and passing the name of a module will list all the scripts and commands contained in the module.
