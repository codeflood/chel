* Round brackets: `(` and `)`
* Square brackets: `[` and `]`
* Curly brackets: `{` and `}`
* Backslash: `\`
* Hash (or pound) sign: `#`
* Dollar sign: `$`

Names cannot contain whitespace, including spaces, tabs and newline characters.

Names can use any other characters, including unicode and even emoji.
