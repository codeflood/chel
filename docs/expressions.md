# Expressions #

An expression is a compact format of evaluation used in conditionals such as the `if` command.

A basic expression consists of 2 values and a comparison operator.

    value operator value

Not all operators can work with all kinds of input. For example, less than `<` and greater than `>` cannot work on values which are not numbers.

_what about only using commands?_

    5 < 3
    lessthan 5 3

hmm...it looks a bit weird. Like Polish notation.
